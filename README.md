Handwritten Digit Classifier: Elegant Edition
This project is an elegant implementation of a handwritten digit classifier using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It allows users to train a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits (0 to 9) with high accuracy.

Overview
Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental task in machine learning and computer vision. This project utilizes the famous MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits. By training a CNN model on the MNIST dataset, the project aims to achieve accurate digit classification.

Features
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model: Utilizes a CNN architecture for image classification, known for its effectiveness in tasks like handwritten digit recognition.
Preprocessing: Includes preprocessing steps such as normalization and reshaping of images to prepare them for input to the CNN model.
Training and Evaluation: Provides functionalities for training the CNN model on the MNIST training dataset and evaluating its performance on the MNIST test dataset.
Prediction: Allows users to make predictions on new handwritten digit images using the trained model.
Scalability: Designed to be scalable, allowing for the incorporation of more advanced CNN architectures and techniques for improved performance.
Usage
Environment Setup: Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the required dependencies (tensorflow, numpy, matplotlib). Optionally, create a virtual environment for this project.
Training the Model: Run the mnist_classification.py script to train the CNN model on the MNIST dataset. The trained model will be saved for future use.
Evaluation: After training, evaluate the model's performance on the MNIST test dataset to assess its accuracy and generalization ability.
Prediction: Use the trained model to make predictions on new handwritten digit images. You can provide your own images or use the provided test images.
Customization: Feel free to customize the CNN architecture, hyperparameters, and training process to improve the model's performance.
